All the text editors are pretty similar to each other, no matter which one we choose, we definitely have to use one. We just have to make sure that it has all the features we need to simplify the coding and make it easier.
The text editors that come with our computers don't have any features.
These are some of the features: Syntax highlighting, code completion, themes, and the ability to choose a healthy extension when we need one.

-It's ok that I am not familiar with the terminal, it will be my friend soon! of course by practicing. -we use the command line or the terminal to write commands in order to do something.
-every operating system has a different terminal.
-the terminal has a shell which is like a screen or display to show exactly what happens when you write a command, the most common one called bash. In order to know which shell we are using we can use command called echo.
-Linux is full of shortcuts to help us, make the life easier and save us from making mistakes. The most beautiful part that when we enter any command it's stored in a history so we can easily find and use it again.

-pwd stands for Print Working Directory, it's a command to tell us the location of where are we now?
-Directory= folder.
-the command ls shows us all the directories and files we have in our current location.
-the square brackets mean that these items are optional.
-There are two types of paths: the absolute and the relative path. Absolute paths specify a location in relation to the root directory(always begin with / ). Relative paths specify a location in relation to where we currently are in the system.
-Command cd stands for change directory, we use in order to move around the system.
-we use dotdot (..) in order to move one directory back.

-everything is actually a file( directories, texts, keyboards, etc.)
-linux ignores the extensions of the files and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.
-linux has case sensitivity, so we have to make sure not to have two or more files with the same name but letters of different case. -To deal with the space issue we either put the item between quotes(’ ‘), or saperate the arguments using backslash(\).
-All the files and directories begin with dot (.) are hidden, in order to list the contents including the hidden files we use the command ls -la.
