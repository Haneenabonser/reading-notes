## Summary   
In this reading notes you will find an introduction to the web world, specifically a brief and general information about HTML and javaScript in a structure of WHAT? HOW? & WHY? 


##  \<HTML\> 
- *What?*    
   HyperText Markup language.
- *Why?*    
   We use it mainly to build the structure of the website.
- *How?*    
   Content within tags. < >

   There are general tips and steps to write a html code, first to tell the browser what version of html we use we type DOCTYPE html at the top of the code, then we write any information about the page within the \<head\> tags, and all the other content within the \<body\> tags. Attributes appear in the opening tag and they have a name and a value.

   In html there are two types of elements:
   - Block elements: always appear to start on a new line (\<h1\>, \<p\>, \<ul\>, \<li\>)
   - In-line elements: (\<em\>, \<b\>, \</b\>)

  


## JavaScript()    
   - *What?*    
    It is an interpreted programming language uses math and logic. 
   - *Why?*    
    We use it to add logic and ineraction to the websites.
   - *How?*    
    We can write javascript code in the same html file using \<script\> tags.
    or we can create a new file with .js extension to write the javasript code inside it and add the link to the html file using \<script src=""\> tag. 


## ABC of Programming     
   ## A 
   The script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal, to approach writing a script we need to think like a computer "programmatically".

   ## B 
   In computer programming, each physical thing in
   the world can be represented as an ***object***, each object has its own:
   - **Properties** 
   - **Events**
   - **Methods** 

   Example for real objects:

   Object: car

   Properties: color, fuel, make

   Events: brake, accelerate

   Method: change speed 

   Computers use data to create models of things in the real world.
   The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other:
   Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties. 

   ## C 
   As I mentioned before, there are two ways to write a script, but is it best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript text file with the extension .js and use the \<script\> element in html pages to tell the browser to load JavaScript file.
