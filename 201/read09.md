## \<HTML\>
- we use form in html to collect data from the visitors.
-A form may have several form controls, each 
gathering different information. The server 
needs to know which piece of inputted data 
corresponds with which form element.
- Structure of form: using form tag, it always has two attributes: action and methos.
-List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in 
different browsers, but there are properties you can 
use to control them and make them more consistent. 
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.

## JavaScript()
*Forms and JS Events*        
What is an Event ?
JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page.
When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.
Developers can use these events to execute JavaScript coded responses, which cause buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually any other type of response imaginable.
Events are a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 and every HTML element contains a set of events which can trigger JavaScript Code.
