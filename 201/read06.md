## JavaScript()      

**JS Objects**     
An object is a set of variables and functions to create a model of something.  
- Variables == *properties*
- Functions == *Methods*    

To create an object:      
Let object = {
    properties,
    method;
};     
To access a property or method for an object;      
Let name = object.property;
Let anotherName = object.method();        

**Document Object Method DOM**   

**What?**            
- Is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.        
**Why?**                        
- It allows JavaScript to manipulate, structure, and style our website.                           
**How?**                   
- The way that the browser represents the page is by using a DOM tree. This tree have four types of NODES:
  - Document nodes.
  - Element nodes.
  - Attribute nodes.
  - Text nodes.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- A NodeList is a collection of document nodes.
- We can use two ways to select an element from a NodeList:
   - The item() method.
   - Array syntax.                                    
- When we have a NodeList, we can loop through each node in the collection and apply the same statements to each.
- Once we have an element node, we can access and update its
content using properties such as:
    - textContent 
    - innerHTML 
    - using DOM manipulation techniques.
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.

## Problem Domain      
         
The first step in writing a program is to determine what kind of information our program will need to represent digitally (such as mathematical operands and operators), and to know what functions we will need to apply to that data (such as addition, or printing an error message to the screen). I refer to this collectively as the problem domain.
