## What Google Learned About Teams
The article talked about someone named  Julia Rozovsky, she had a lot of jobs but she was always looking for a job more social. After she intered the management school she experianced to be a member of two groups, in the first one  she felt like she was always scared of doing mistakes and the judgment from her teammates, she left the group and started looking for a new one, in the seconed group she felt excactly the opposite and the won a competion togather.            

There are also a lot of studies about teams mentiond in the article. In speaking fo groups, studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction. 
Researchers did a study on 180 teams inside google, As they struggled to figure out what made a team successful, Rozovsky and her colleagues kept coming across research by psychologists and sociologists that focused on what are known as group norms/traditins.                                
After a year of collecting data, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Googleâ€™s teams. 

**Conclusion** 
In conclusion of all the stories and the studies I have read, there are always a bad team or an effictive and successful team, here are some of the qualities of a successful team:
- It's about creating a safe culture in which team members feel "safe" enough to take an interpersonal risk.
- When everyone on the team is accountable, reliable and trustworthy, the team succeeds.
- Everyone got a chance to talk, not only one person or a small group spoke all the time.
- There should always be a clear plan and agenda, each team member not only understands their own work and expectations but also what their fellow team members are working on.
