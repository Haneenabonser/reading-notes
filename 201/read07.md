 
**Domain Modeling-constructor**
what?     
 is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.        
 Why?  
 To define the same properties between many objects.
 How?       
 Is defined using a function expression.   

## JavaScript() 
To create an object constructor notation:              
Let haneen = new Object();
- Sometimes we will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects by:

   - create the template with the object's properties and methods. 
   - the **new** keyword+ call to function.(the properties of each object are given as arguments).

- Arrays are a special type of object.
- Ww can combine arrays and objects iside each other to create comlex data structures.   
- There are three groups of built-in objects:
      - Date
      - Math 
      - Regex
- to create Date object:     
Let today = new Date();

## \<HTML\>
**Tables**    
- Basic table stucture:
\<table\>
\<tr\>
\<td\>\</td\>
\</tr\>
\</table\>
- we use \<th\> element to represent the head for either column or row.
- we use attribute colspan to spaning columns.
- we use attribute colsrow to spaning rows.
- To create a long table we add to the basic structure and split the table into them:
\<thead\>           
                
\<tbody\>                    
 
\<tfoot\>
