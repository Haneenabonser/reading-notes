**CSS Layout**          

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box, this box will either be a:
- block-level: the elements that start in a new line (p, h, ul, li)
- inline: in between the text (img, b, i)       
   
**Containing** or **parent** elemnts: we use them in order to group a number of elements inside one element, it is common to use \<div\> as a containing element. 
Example:        
We put all the conent of the header inside a \<div\>,    
and all the conent of the main inside a seconed \<div\>,     
and the footer content inside a thierd \<div\>.       
all those divs have a containing element which is the \<body\>.
