## \<HTML\>

Now we know that HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page, we add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. 
there are two types of tags:
- Structural tags: : the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.

- Semantic tags: : which provides extra information. 

## \{CSS\}
- *What?*    
   Cascading Style Sheet.
- *Why?*    
   We use for style/ presentation of the website.
- *How?*    
   There are three ways to write a css code:
   - Inline   
   By adding a style attribute    
   \<p style="color:red"\>Text\<p\>
   - Internal      
   inside the same HTML file, in the head, using \<style\> tag.   
   \<style\> p{color; red} \</style\>    
  - External   
  By creating a css file and link it inside the html file, the head.    
  \<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/\>    p{color:red; ...}     


## JavaScript() 

  **Variables** are containers for storing data values. we declare a variable by give it a name and assign it by give it a value:    
  ex:      
  Var userName= "haneen";     
  *It is a good prctice to write the variable name in camel case*      

  **Data Types** in JavaSript:
  - Strings: anything in "" or ''
  - Numbers: all types
  - Boolean: True or False

  **Operators**      
  - Assignment operators:     
  += : x+=7 : x=x+7     

  - Arithmatic Operators:
  (+ , - , * , / , % ,)       

  - Comparison Operators:


   | operator    | Purpose                          |
   |-------------|----------------------------------|
   |    ==       | compare the value only           |
   |    ===      | compare the value & the data type|
   |    !=       | not equal, the value             |
   |    !==      | not equal, value & data type     |
   |    <        | smaller than                     |
   |    >        | bigger than                      |
   |    <=       | smaller than or equal            |
   |    >=       | bigger than or equal             |              
   |||                             

         
              

- Logical Operators:       
          
         
   | operator    |   Purpose    |
   |-------------|--------------|
   |     &&      | logical and  |
   |     \|\|    | logical or   |
   |      !      | logical not  |                          




**Loops**        
There are two types of loops:
- For loops:       
we use it when we know how many times the code will repeat.     
for (var i=0; i<5 ; i++){ Do this Code} 


- While loops:        
we use it when we need to run a code for unlimitid times. (it keeps run the condition until the condition is false)       
      while (condition) { Do This Code }        


## Definition List
- Variable: containers for storing data values.
- Array:  is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
- Operator: symbol that does an action. 
- Camel case: a good practice way to write variables name in JavaScript, upperCase letter in the middle like the back of the camel.
- Concatination: Addindg two strings together using plus.
