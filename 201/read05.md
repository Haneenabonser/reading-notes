## <\HTML\>
**Images** 
We use \<img\> element to add images to our web pages.       
- \<img\> is a self-closing tag. 
- There are a lot of attributes for image tag:
-src: to indicate the 
source of an image (a must).
-alt:  to describe the 
content of an image (a must).
- Width: specifies the width of the 
image in pixels.
- Height: specifies the height of the 
image in pixels.
- align: to indicate how 
the other parts of a page should 
flow around an image.

**JPEG vs PNG vs GIG**
- JPEG : for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.
- PNG : for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.
- GIF : for images that contain animations.
