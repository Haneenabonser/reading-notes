## Intro
JavaScript is a programming language that allows dynamic interactive, it tells the browser what it should do when certain things happen, like click on a button or sign up for an account, etc.. 

A script is a series of instructions(like a recipe or a handbook) that the computer can follow one-by-one to achieve a goal. Script can allow the browser to check the current situation and only perform a set of steps if that action is appropriate.

In order to write a script, you have to: Define the goal, design the script, code each step. 
Break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task. 
We can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. 




## Expressions and operators 

There are two types of expressions: 
- expressions that just assign a value to a variable( var color = ‘blue’; 
- expressions use two or more values to return one single value( var area = 3*2 )

The operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. (+, *, <, >, -,%).

Arithmetic operators: we can use it with numbers.

|  Operator   |    Purpose                      |
|-------------|---------------------------------|
|     +       |Adds one value to another        |
|     -       |Subtracts one value from another |
|     /       |Divides two values               |
|     *       |Multiplies two values            |
|     %       |Divides two values and returns the remainder|




String Operators: 

There is just one string operator: the+ symbol. It is used to join the strings on either side of it. 

We can also mix srings and numberes togather.
