## Event Driven Applications


### Review, Research, and Discussion
- Why is access control important?
    - They mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation,
- Describe an application that would need access control.
    - I think any application needs to be updated to its database will need access control to keep everything safe and secure.
- What is a role used for?
    - To specify the capabilities for each user based on his "role".
- Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
    - At the broadest level, RBAC helps maximize operational efficiency, protects your data from being leaked or stolen, reduces admin and IT support work, and makes it easier to meet audit requirements.


### Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- Authorization: (What you can see based on who you are), is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular. More formally, "to authorize" is to define an access policy.
- Role Based Access Control: Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. 
- Capabilities: It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. A user program on a capability-based operating system must use a capability to access an object.

    - javascript events.

### Preparation Materials
- Event Driven Programming
> An event-driven program is one that largely responds to user events or other similar input. The concept of event-driven programming is an important one in application development and other kinds of programming, and has spawned the emergence of event handlers and other resources.

- Node docs: events
> Every action on a computer is an event. Like when a connection is made or a file is opened.
