## SQL

### Complete SQLBolt 
- What is SQL?
    - SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
    - SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database. 
    - Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

### A Primer on SQL
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is the de-facto standard for interacting with
relational databases.
- Almost all database management systems you’ll come across will have a SQL implementation.
- SQL was standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
- A database is nothing but a collection of organized data. It doesn’t have to be in a digital format to
be called a database.
- The most prevalent database organizational model is the Relational Model.

### Termonology 
- DBMS: (Database Management System), a software which is used to manage a digital database.
- 'relational' in relational database: It is a common misconception that the word relational implies relationship between the tables. A relation is a mathematical term that is roughly equivalent to a table itself. When
used in conjunction with the word database, we mean to say that this particular system
arranges data in a tabular fashion.
