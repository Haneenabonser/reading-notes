### How to Solve Programming Problems       
1-Read the problem completely twice, to make sure you completely understand the problem.                      
2-Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.                        
3-Optimize the manual steps, it is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.                                             
4-Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code, put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.                             
5-Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.                                    
6-Optimize the real code.                


### Act like you make $1000/hr 
***TIME IS MONEY*** try to not waste your time on pointless activities, value your time at what it deserves to be. The higher the value, the more important and productive work you’ll do.                             

### How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving
Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems (which is what I did when I started coding):             
Try a solution.               
If that doesn’t work, try another one.                      
If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out. 

*The best way involves a) having a framework and b) practicing it.*

### 5 Whys
>  This is a simple but powerful tool for cutting quickly through the outward symptoms of a problem to reveal its underlying causes, so that you can deal with it once and for all, you can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.  

*How to Use the 5 Whys?*     
1. Assemble a Team                    
Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem
2. Define the Problem                   
observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.
3. Ask the First "Why?"             
Ask your team why the problem is occurring
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times                 
For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.
5. Know When to Stop                   
6. Address the Root Cause(s)         
You need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.
7. Monitor Your Measures                 
Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem


### The Super Mario Effect
The Super Mario Effect is explained as “focusing on the Princess and not the pits, to stick with a task and learn more.” The beauty of The Super Mario Effect is that it can free us up from the fear of failure. It is “learning from, but not focusing on, the failures,” where not making it past level one doesn’t mean you give up, it means you learn from what you did wrong and try again.
