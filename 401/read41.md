## React Native

### Review, Research, and Discussion
- Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”?
    - There is no big difference, RTK gives us more functionalities in an easier way.
- What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit?
    - Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience.

### Document the following Vocabulary Terms
- redux toolkit slices: a function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic.

- namespace: is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers, used to organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.

### Preparation Materials
***React Native**
- React Native (also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.
- React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components.
- Thousands of apps are using React Native, from established Fortune 500 companies to hot new startups; facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Discord and a lot of other apps.
