Growth mindset is believing that people's abilities can be developed through hard work, good strategies, and input from others. Brains and talent are just the starting point, I think this view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.

**How I keep myself in a growth mindset?**
- Learn from other peopleâ€™s mistakes.
- Do not compare myself with anyone.
- Make a new goal for every goal accomplished.
