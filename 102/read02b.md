Git is a system stores data in a file made up of snapshots. It makes like a tree to root every file with a new change to a reference file, that change is called commit.

There are three states of the files in Git: committed(Data is securely stored), modified(changed but not committed), and staged(flagged to be committed in the next snapshot). Consequently, the life cycle of file status is: edited and got a flag>> modified>> commits.
