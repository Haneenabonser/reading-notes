Process and design 
In order to build or create a website you have to approach a process, that process contains: 
-understand who our target audience is? Are they individuals or companies? Like what are their ages and where they live if they are individuals, or how many people in the company and what are their positions? We have to know all the answers of Those all questions in order to understand our target audience.
-Then, we have to know why those people visit the website, what are trying to achieve by visiting the website, what information they need, and how often visit the website. 
Afterwards, we have to start the design phase by doing a wireframe, is something like a sketch or preliminary design of what the final product will be. 
-We can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy  (size, color, style) and helps users find what they are looking for. Also, we can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information we present.
-The navigation bar is very important, it helps people understand what our site is about and helps them find where they want to go. 

Structure
HTML is the markup language used to build the structure of any website, all the content in it is wrapped in tags <>, we have both self-closing tags and tags have an opening and closing tag. 
Tags may have attributes that require a name and a value.
The main tags are <head>and <body>, the content in the head will not be shown it's just the information about the website. The body has 3-main parts:
<header>
<main>
<footer>.

HTML5 layout:
HTML5 introduces a set of elements, the name of those elements indicate the kind of content in them. 
<header> at the top of the webpage 
<footer> at the bottom 
<section> groups the related content togather
<article> act like a container for any section 
<div> for sectioning elements 
and a lot of other elements. 
-We can make HTML5 elements work in older versions of IE by using extra JavaScript. 

Extra Markup
-The first line of the code should be !<DOCTYPE html> to tell the browser that I use html5.
-To identify particular elements we use I'd and class. 
-To add any comment to our code we use <!-- the comment-->
-to add any symbol to our code we type &symbolcode; 
-<meta> elements live inside the head so it's not visible for the users. 
-We use <inframe> element to cut windows into our webpages.
