## Design web pages with CSS

 Allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element shoud appear, it tells the browser **How** the content should look.

> CSS works by associating rules with HTML, the rule contains two parts: 
- selector (indicate which element the rule applies to).
- Declaration (indicate how the selector should appear).

> the declaration: *{properity: Value}*

we can specify several properties in one declaration each separated by a semi-colon ;

CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although thay may appear within an HTML page. 


### Color 
 
RGBA: 
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color. An RGBA color value is specified with: rgba(red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, blue, and green. To find the color we want we can use a color picker. 

Opacity property specifies how transparent an element is. it has a default initial value of 1 (the value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0).

HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. HSLA color values are an extension of HSL.

It's important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color.
