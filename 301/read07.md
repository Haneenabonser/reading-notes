## REST 
**What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team**
**Conclusion** 
In conclusion of all the stories and the studies I have read in this article, there are always a bad team or an effictive and successful team, here are some of the qualities of a successful team:
- It's about creating a safe culture in which team members feel "safe" enough to take an interpersonal risk.
- When everyone on the team is accountable, reliable and trustworthy, the team succeeds.
- Everyone got a chance to talk, not only one person or a small group spoke all the time.
- There should always be a clear plan and agenda, each team member not only understands their own work and expectations but also what their fellow team members are working on.

**How I explained REST to my brother**
- Who is Roy Fielding?
    - Roy Fielding  helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does.
- Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    - Because they weren't designed to be used like that, most of the techniques developers after Fielding used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    - this protocol Fielding and his friends created is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
- What does a GET do?
    - Getting stuff and retrieve information.
- What does a POST do?
    - If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.
- What does PUT do?
    - If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.
- What does PATCH do?
    - If a system wants to do partial update, it uses an HTTP verb of PATCH.
