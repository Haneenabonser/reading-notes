## comparison oporators

Evaluating conditions: to evaluate a situation by comparing a value in the script to what you expect it might be. 
we use them in conditional statments, the result will be a boolean (Yes or No)



| operator    | Purpose                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
|    ==       | compare the value only           |
|    ===      | compare the value & the data type|
|    !=       | not equal, the value             |
|    !==      | not equal, value & data type     |
|    <        | smaller than                     |
|    >        | bigger than                      |
|    <=       | smaller than or equal            |
|    >=       | bigger than or equal             |


Logical Operators: These operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

| operator    |   Purpose    |
|-------------|--------------|
|     &&      | logical and  |
|     \|\|    | logical or   |
|      !      | logical not  |




## Loops

Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false when analysed. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.

There are three common types of loops:
- For loops
- While loops 
- Do while loops 

### For loops: 
The (for) statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false. The loop counter is the variable that controls the iterations of a loop.

### While loops:
If we don't know how many times the code should run, we can use a while loop. The condition can be something ather than a counter.
